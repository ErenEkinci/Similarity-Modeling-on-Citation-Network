# Similarity-Modeling-on-Citation-Network

This is my Web Scale Algorithm course project. The problem we tried to solve was to find articles with similar citations. Our data contains a citation graph. For more information, you can read the project report.

## Run

To run project compile all files using compile.sh and run files with run.sh

```sh
./compile.sh
./run.sh
```

final.txt file contains similar pairs with their jaccard similarity values.
